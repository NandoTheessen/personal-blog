# GO sounds awesome.

Ever since I heard of Go, I was really keen on working with it. It *almost* sounds too good to be true: <br>
Nearing C/C++ speeds with garbage-collection, green threads for easy concurrency *and* it does not feel like it was found in a museum (like C sometimes does).<br>
It's not only popular but devs working with it really like it! You can see this in the [stack overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted) developer survey where it made the top 5 and top 3 respectively for the most loved & wanted languages for two years in a row.

Naturally, Go always was on my *AwesomeTechThatIReallyWantToLearn*-list, but between my last big project and my previous position with [Lambda School](https://bit.ly/2C0iMRI) I never really had the time to dive in. <br>

# The new position

During my search for a new position in February I was fortunate enough to be offered a position with a German startup working with Go (and AWS Serverless, GraphQL & DynamoDB).<br>
Since learning new things is like my favorite thing, I pounced at the opportunity and have officially joined them with the beginning of March.<br>
Needless to say I'm happy to have such an *amazing* opportunity, learning a new language on the job!
