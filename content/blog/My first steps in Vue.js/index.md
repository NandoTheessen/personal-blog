## What I did before becoming a Software Engineer

Before I decided a career change was in order, I dabbled in a lot of things.
After school I joined an agency in Berlin, raising funds for non-profit organizations like Amnesty International, the WWF and the SOS Kinderd√∂rfer. After a few successful years, I turned into a professional online poker player and even owned my own small start up for over a year before closing shop.
I did not have any experience when it comes to engineering, although I'm pretty good with computers in general.

Since being a poker professional really can't be associated with stable income and the startup - while  being a great learning experience - ultimately failed and we were planning to start a family, I needed to change yet again.

During this time of my life, I discovered that there were quite a few bootcamps that had started growing here in Germany.
Some of them taught web development, some taught Java, all of them cost quite a bit of money and were  9 weeks long. 
On first glance this looked like a very good fit for me, it would give me a shortcut into a new industry, allow me to work with a computer and probably get me the stable income I was looking for.
