# Every beginning is tough



Ever since I heard of Go, I was really keen on working with it. It's supposed to be extremely fast, has green threads (Go routines are handled by the runtime instead of the OS) and everyone that touches it, seems to simply love it.<br>
You can see this in the stack overflow dev survey where it made the top 5 and top 3 respectively for the most loved & wanted languages for two years in a row.

It *almost* sounds too good to be true: <br>
nearing C/C++ speeds while being a garbage-collected language and without feeling like it is coming straight out of a museum (like C sometimes does).
