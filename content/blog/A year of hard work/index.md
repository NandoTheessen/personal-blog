## What I did before becoming a Software Engineer

Before I decided a career change was in order, I dabbled in a lot of things.
After school I joined an agency in Berlin, raising funds for non-profit organizations like Amnesty International, the WWF and the SOS Kinderd√∂rfer. After a few successful years, I turned into a professional online poker player and even owned my own small start up for over a year before closing shop.
I did not have any experience when it comes to engineering, although I'm pretty good with computers in general.

Since being a poker professional really can't be associated with stable income and the startup - while being a great learning experience - ultimately failed and we were planning to start a family, I needed to change yet again.

## How I got in touch with a school

During this time, I discovered that there were quite a few bootcamps that had started growing here in Germany.
Some of them taught web development, some taught Java, all of them cost quite a bit of money and were 9 weeks long.
On first glance this looked like a very good fit for me, it would give me a shortcut into a new industry, allow me to work with a computer and probably get me the stable income I was looking for.

## Lambda School

I registered with one of the bootcamps here in Berlin and was about to start when I learned about [Lambda School](https://bit.ly/2C0iMRI). <br>Their program came with a lot of promises that I found interesting.
It focussed a lot more on computer science, taught JavaScript, Python AND C and best of all there were **no** upfront cost.<br> It sounded a bit too good to be true to me to be honest.
As it turned out they weren't even taking international students, so I prepared for the start of my bootcamp in Berlin.<br>
All of that changed quickly, when Karin Zachary (who is fantastic and in charge of admissions over @LambdaSchool) reached out to me and told me that I was one out of 5 international students selected to join as part of a pilot project.

## Giving school another go

What followed were 7 months of curriculum work.<br>
Two hours of instructions every day, a project to build, stand ups, pair programming and a sprint challenge to solve every week.<br>
It definitely was hard. Sitting down every night from 5pm - 2am (the downside to join a school that is not yet in Europe) and learning foreign concepts, working with them and maintaining sanity at the same time was one of the toughest challenges I faced in my life. <br>But I had a goal and in addition I really enjoy learning new things & solving problems although it can of course get frustrating at times.

## What can make you (and me) stand out as a student

There are of course a lot of things you can do, to gather the respect of your fellow students and teachers, but the following two I think are pretty important.

Due to the nature of any school that teaches software engineering and the limited amount of time they have to teach you, you'll automatically become more of a generalist.

You get to know a wealth of things in a fairly short amount of time.
I don't even think this is a downside, but something you have to keep in mind.
For me this meant, investing extra time I had (either by being done early or by using free time) into getting really good at major parts.
I think most of my time went into JavaScript, as we used it for the front (React) & the back end (express).
There are some fantastic resources out there (shout out to [Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) and his books / courses) you can use to get **really** good at topics you would've otherwise just brushed over.

Especially in a remote school like [Lambda School](https://bit.ly/2C0iMRI) it is **extremely** important that you are honest with yourself. Of course it can be appealing to just do what is necessary to get a pass on the day or the week, but this is not what will land you that job you are after.

`Within your limits, invest all time you have available into getting as good as you can.`
