## What I did before becoming a Software Engineer

Before I decided a career change was in order, I dabbled in a lot of things.
After school I joined an agency in Berlin, raising funds for non-profit organizations like Amnesty International, the WWF and the SOS Kinderd√∂rfer. After a few successful years, I turned into a professional online poker player and even owned my own small start up for over a year before closing shop.
I did not have any experience when it comes to engineering, although I'm pretty good with computers in general.

Since being a poker professional really can't be associated with stable income and the startup - while  being a great learning experience - ultimately failed and we were planning to start a family, I needed to change yet again.

## How I got in touch with a school

During this time of my life, I discovered that there were quite a few bootcamps that had started growing here in Germany.
Some of them taught web development, some taught Java, all of them cost quite a bit of money and were  9 weeks long. 
On first glance this looked like a very good fit for me, it would give me a shortcut into a new industry, allow me to work with a computer and probably get me the stable income I was looking for.

## Lambda School

I registered with one of the bootcamps here in Berlin and was about to start when I learned about [Lambda School](https://bit.ly/2C0iMRI). Their program came with a lot of promises that I found interesting. 
It focussed a lot more on computer science, taught JavaScript, Python AND C and best of all there were **no** upfront cost. It sounded a bit too good to be true to me to be honest.
As it turned out they weren't even taking international students, so I prepared for the start of my bootcamp in Berlin. 
All of that changed quickly, when Karin Zachary (who is fantastic and in charge of admissions over @LambdaSchool) reached out to me and told me that I was one out of 5 international students selected to join as part of a pilot project.

## Giving school another go

What followed were 7 months of curriculum work.
Two hours of instructions every day, a project to build, stand ups, pair programming and a sprint challenge to solve every week.
It definitely was hard. Sitting down every night from 5pm - 2am (the downside to join a school that is not yet in Europe) and learning foreign concepts, working with them and maintaining sanity at the same time was one of the toughest challenges I faced in my life. But I had a goal and in addition I really enjoy learning new things & solving problems although it can of course get frustrating at times.
