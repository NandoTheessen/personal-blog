# First steps in Vue.js coming from a React background

While on the job hunt I interviewed with a company that was using Vue.js & Python / Django in the backend.
I've worked with Django on side projects but have never touched Vue so far, so these will be my first steps
and how I approach learning something new.

I hope this provides to be somewhat useful for you.

## The Approach

As always, my first point of contact is the documentation. And luckily Vue.js has a very solid one you can
find [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).
