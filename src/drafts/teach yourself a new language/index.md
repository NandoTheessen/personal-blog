description: What helped me to start contributing in Go immediately
---

I recently started a new position which required me to re-invent myself.
Most of my professional experience is working with JavaScript on both sides of the stack (mainly React & Express) and it's ecosystem.
My new job however has me developing micro services in Golang, deploy using AWS Lambda and tie everything together with GraphQL. Neither of which I have worked with.

In this article I'd like to take you along my journey in becoming able to contribute as fast as possible and show you the 3 things - in no particular order - that I did to make that happen.

## 1: Find Resources That Are Useful

Finding good resources feels surprisingly hard these days. This mostly stems from the sheer amount of content out there.
There are at least 15 video courses that are advertised to take you from being an absolute beginner to mastery in 4 hours, personally I don't like to use them though.

What is most important about the resource you choose is that it is adequate for your skill level.
If you've been working in engineering for even half a year, you probably don't want an in-depth explanation on for-loops for example.
That said, I think the resources below shouldn't bore you and give you a good starting point.

#### Intro

A great intro to the language is the official tour that you can find [here](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1).
It takes you through the basic concepts of the language and has concrete examples and exercises that help you familiarize yourself with the basics.

I think it's a great resource regardless of if Go is going to be your first language or you've worked with others before. Although it will be more challenging of course.

As a next step, I'd recommend at least reading through [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) which is also part of the official resources.

#### Beyond The Basics

One thing that really helped me was reading up on best practices in Go and comparing those to other languages I have worked with.
Translating concepts I'm already familiar with into the new context helps me understand what is going on in a new codebase or how to design the new service I have to write for example.

A great resource for this would be [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html). I've also found a few talks that really helped me understand the Go ecosystem and gave me an in on the quirks that I should be looking out for: [Go Says WAT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPd0Cxzsslk&t=999s) or [Things in Go I never Use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DVV36uqQ4E).


## 2: There Is No Shortcut.

One of the biggest misconceptions about learning a new concept, language or framework is how you can do so effectively.
I've learned with and worked next to a lot of great people that had an account with any of the big learning sites or had a big library of courses on technologies that wanted to learn. 
I myself had a similar library.

Sadly - in most cases - just following a tutorial or a course does **not** make you a lot better in something new. 
Often times it absolves you from thinking yourself and thus hampers your progress rather than speeding it up like you had hoped.

This is not to say, you shouldn't look up things that might help with something you are building by the way. What I hope this tells your is that you should shoot for your own solutions and projects.


#### What You Should Do Instead: Build Things!

From my experience of working with a lot of beginners and learning myself, what really helps people get good with languages and development in general is having their fingers on keyboards and working on code.
